* Height, ? (will update later)
* Pronouns, He/him
* Chumhandle, malaiseMessiah (bc he WOULD call himself a messiah. ...ironically.)
* Typing quirk, ---double hyphens before everything, Because hes a guy muttering sarcastic shit under his breath at all times. || Aa=AA Oo=00 Ss=Zz Ii=11 ||
I know he is a kid and not a troll but i wanted to use typing quirks. I asked people if its wrong and they said its fine so...yeah.

How would he be like?,
Grady is one of those kids who's too smart but in all the wrong ways. The kind of guy who read Nietzsche at 14, not because anyone told him to, but because he found a PDF on some shady website at 3AM and thought, "---yeAh th1z feelz r1ght". He absolutely has that whole self-aware, ironic asshole energy — like he knows he's a walking stereotype, but instead of trying to break out of it, he leans into the spiral out of spite.

His whole deal is rage disguised as apathy. He acts like nothing matters, but it's because he's so pissed off at how much everything actually does matter to him. The hoodie? Permanent. Eye bags? Built into his character sprite. Sleep? Not in this lifetime.

Lore Drop,
Grady Hayes was always one of those kids who figured out the world was bullshit way too early. The kind of kid who realized adults were just winging it by the time he was like... eight. He stopped believing in God on a random Tuesday and didn't even tell anyone. He just quietly filed it away like yeah, that makes sense.

Why Is He in Sburb?
Grady is the last one to join the game. The kind of kid who gets added to the group chat five minutes before the Reckoning kicks off because someone said, oh yeah, we need one more player. He didn't even want to play. He barely even talks to the others outside of sending cryptic messages at weird hours.

His Symbol,
A Fading Eye
A fading eye could symbolize how Grady’s trying to see the world for what it is, but everything is blurry and he’s exhausted. Maybe it’s a hollow eye with some messy, glitchy streaks around it, suggesting that seeing things clearly is a struggle

His room/Personal Space,
Grady’s whole situation with his room really mirrors his internal struggle. He’s too tired and worn out to put in the effort to clean up, but he still has that innate desire to control his surroundings, and the messiness eats at him. It’s like he’s fighting against himself, wanting order but feeling too mentally drained to do anything about it.

The idea that he gets mad if someone else tries to clean is perfect, too—his room is a private little world, and no one is allowed to interfere with his chaos. It's almost like an extension of his mind, a place where everything is disorganized, but only he knows where things really go. It's part of his control over things, even if it seems like he's lost control altogether.
